## About
SO3LR - pronounced *Solar* - is a pretrained machine-learned force field for (bio)molecular simulations. It integrates the fast and stable SO3krates neural network for semi-local interactions with universal pairwise force fields designed for short-range repulsion, long-range electrostatics, and dispersion interactions.
## Installation
SO3RL can be either used with CPU or with GPU. If you want to use SO3LR on GPU, you have to install the 
corresponding JAX installation via 
```shell script
# SO3LR on GPU
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install "jax[cuda12]"
```
If you want to use SO3LR on CPU, e.g. for testing on your local machine which does not have a GPU, you can do
```shell script
# SO3LR on CPU
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jax
```
Note, that SO3LR will be much fast on GPU than on CPU, so large scale simulations are ideally performed on a GPU. More 
details about JAX installation can be found [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Next clone the repository and install by doing 
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/general-molecular-simulations/so3lr.git
cd so3lr
pip install .
```
## Evaluation
Evaluating SO3LR can be done via the command line interface (CLI) using the command `evaluate-so3lr`. The input can 
be any file that is digestible by [`ase.io.iread`](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/io/io.html#ase.io.iread). 
**Please note, that the labels are assumed to be in `eV` and `Angstrom`.** SO3LR can be evaluated on an input file 
saved at `$FILEPATH` like 
```shell script
evaluate-so3lr --datafile $FILEPATH --batch-size 2 --lr-cutoff 100 --save-predictions-to predictions.extxyz
```
For all details use `evaluate-so3lr --help`. The above command will collect and print the metrics on the dataset and 
save the predictions to `predictions.extxyz`. The predicted properties are `energy`, `forces`, `dipole_vec` 
and `hirshfeld_ratios`. Energy and forces are assumed to be present in the datafile, while dipole vectors and Hirshfeld
ratios are optional. If they are not present in the data, the metrics will simply be `NaN`. **On that note, we want to
stretch that SO3LR has not been trained on energies.** Therefore, errors are not reported in the printed metrics and 
only relative energies have a meaning. The predictions can be loaded afterwards in `python` as 
````python
import numpy as np

from ase.io import iread

property = 'forces'

true = []
so3lr = []
for a in iread('predictions.extxyz'):
    true.append(a.get_forces())
    so3lr.append(a.arrays[f'{property}_so3lr'])

rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.square(np.stack(true) - np.stack(so3lr))))
print(rmse)

````
If you want to do the full evaluation `python` via the `so3lr_base_calculator`, check out the 
[example notebook](https://github.com/general-molecular-simulations/so3lr/blob/main/examples/evaluate_so3lr_on_dataset.ipynb).

## Atomic Simulation Environment
To get an Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) calculator with energies and forces predicted
from SO3LR just do 
```python
import numpy as np

from so3lr import So3lrCalculator
from ase import Atoms

atoms = Atoms('H2', positions=[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0.74)])
atoms.info['charge'] = 0.0

calc = So3lrCalculator(
    calculate_stress=False,
    dtype=np.float32
)
atoms.calc = calc

energy = atoms.get_potential_energy()
forces = atoms.get_forces()

print('Energy and forces in ASE')
print('Energy = ', energy)
print('Forces = ', forces)

```
## JAX MD
Large scale simulations can be performed via jax-md which is a molecular dynamics library optimized for GPUs. Here we 
give a small example for a structure in vacuum. For realistic simulations with periodic water boxes take a look at the 
`./examples/` folder.
```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import numpy as np

from ase import Atoms
from jax_md import space
from jax_md import quantity

from so3lr import to_jax_md
from so3lr import So3lrPotential

atoms = Atoms('H2', positions=[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0.74)])
assert np.asarray(
        atoms.get_pbc()
    ).all().item() is False, "Readme example assumes no box. See `examples/` folder for simulations in box."

positions = jnp.array(atoms.get_positions())
atomic_numbers = jnp.array(atoms.get_atomic_numbers()) 

# We assume there is no box.
box = None
displacement, shift = space.free()

neighbor_fn, neighbor_fn_lr, energy_fn = to_jax_md(
    potential=So3lrPotential(),
    displacement_or_metric=displacement,
    box_size=box,
    species=atomic_numbers,
    capacity_multiplier=1.25,
    buffer_size_multiplier_sr=1.25,
    buffer_size_multiplier_lr=1.25,
    minimum_cell_size_multiplier_sr=1.0,
    disable_cell_list=True,
    fractional_coordinates=False
)

# Energy and force functions.
energy_fn = jax.jit(energy_fn)
force_fn = jax.jit(quantity.force(energy_fn))

# Initialize the short and long-range neighbor lists.
nbrs = neighbor_fn.allocate(
    positions, 
    box=box
)
nbrs_lr = neighbor_fn_lr.allocate(
    positions, 
    box=box
)
energy = energy_fn(
    positions, 
    neighbor=nbrs.idx,
    neighbor_lr=nbrs_lr.idx,
    box=box
)
forces = force_fn(
    positions, 
    neighbor=nbrs.idx,
    neighbor_lr=nbrs_lr.idx,
    box=box
)
print('Energy and forces in JAX-MD')
print('Energy = ', np.array(energy))
print('Forces = ', np.array(forces))
```

### CLI

We also include the option to run MD simulations via JAX MD through the CLI. For this all you have to do is run the following command and give the path to a settings file (.yaml).


```shell script
md-so3lr --settings $FILEPATH
```

By running the following command you can see all settings and their defaults. Additionally, a file containing this info is provided in `so3lr/cli/md_settings.md`.

```shell script
md-so3lr --help
```

By only providing an `initial_geometry`, a short NVT simulation is launched.
Currently, NVT and NPT are supported using the Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat or barostat. For optimization the FIRE algorithm is used as implemented in JAX MD.
The trajectories will be saved efficiently using `.hdf5` files. In addition, checkpoints can be saved as `.npz` files throughout the simulation to restart it if needed.
SO3LR is used by default. In case you want to use your own model you have to specify the path in the settings at `model_path`.

## Potential energy function
To obtain a potential energy function which is not specifally tailored for `jax-md` we provide a convenience 
interface. You can do  
```python
from so3lr import So3lrPotential
from so3lr import Graph

graph = Graph(...)

so3lr_potential = So3lrPotential()

energy = so3lr_potential(graph)
```
The `Graph` object is a `collections.namedtuple` which abstracts the molecule as a graph common practice in the 
context of message passing neural networks. The `So3lrPotential` is a pure `python` function which takes a graph as 
an input and returns a potential energy. It is compatible with common `jax` transformations as `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`, 
`jax.grad`, `...`. Its use targets developers, interested in integrating SO3LR into their own MD code base. From a 
high-level perspective, all that needs to be done is to define some function `system_to_graph` which transforms 
whatever input structure one has to a `Graph` object. Passed to `so3lr_potential` one gets the potential energy of 
the system.
## Datasets
The quantum mechanical datasets used for training and testing SO3LR are available on Zenodo:
